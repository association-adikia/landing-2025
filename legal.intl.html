            <h1>Legal Notice</h1>

            <p>This website is published by ADIKIA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Head office: Paris, France</li>
                <li>Contact: <a href="mailto:contact@adikia.us"><strong>contact@adikia.us</strong></a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The name of ADIKIA comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Greek</a> αδικία, meaning “injustice”. ADIKIA’s objectives are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Inform professionals and the public</strong> about the current state of scientific knowledge concerning medical diagnoses of child abuse in infants, about their differential diagnoses, and about the importance of making the most reliable distinction possible between the two.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide spaces for dialogue and exchange</strong> for parents, childminders, and families confronted with such diagnoses, with the aim of offering mutual moral and psychological support, and allow families who wish to do so to share their testimonies, while respecting their privacy, intimacy, and the laws in force.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote the evolution of diagnostic protocols</strong>, reporting criteria, judicial procedures, legislation, and professional practices, with the goal of improving respect for all rights of the Child and human rights in the decisions and procedures undertaken in these situations<strong>, while respecting the indispensable needs of child protection</strong>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Support</h2>
            <p>ADIKIA only covers cases of unjustified medical diagnoses of child abuse in infants with fragilities or conditions causing bone, skin, or vascular lesions.</p>
            <p>ADIKIA cannot respond to requests for help in other cases, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>acts of violence, neglect, or abuse;</li>
                <li>“wrongful placements” for reasons other than medical;</li>
                <li>“false allegations”.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Individuals responsible for acts of violence against children are not admitted into ADIKIA.</p>
            <p>ADIKIA provides members with spaces for exchange to allow families to share their experiences and to provide mutual psychological support.</p>
            <p>ADIKIA is in no way bound by any judicial proceedings undertaken individually by its members. ADIKIA is an apolitical organization not linked to the political commitments or contacts of its members. Publicly expressed opinions made individually by ADIKIA members do not bind ADIKIA.</p>
