                <li><strong>Provide spaces for dialogue and exchange</strong> for parents, childminders, and families confronted with such diagnoses, with the aim of offering mutual moral and psychological support, and allow families who wish to do so to share their testimonies, while respecting their privacy, intimacy, and the laws in force.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote the evolution of diagnostic protocols</strong>, reporting criteria, judicial procedures, legislation, and professional practices, with the goal of improving respect for all rights of the Child and human rights in the decisions and procedures undertaken in these situations, while respecting the indispensable needs of child protection.</li>
